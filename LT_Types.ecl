    * Tree node data

    * 1) It represents all of the X,Y data associated with each tree and node as the
    *   forest is being built.  This case is recognized by id > 0 (i.e. it is a data point)
    *   wi, treeId, level, and NodeId represent the work-item and tree node with which the data is currently
    *         associated.
    *         All data in a trees sample is originally assigned to the root node (level = 1, nodeId = 1)
    *         of its associated tree.
    *   id is the sample index in this trees data bootstrap sample
    *   origId is the sample index in the original X data.
    *   number is the field number from the X data
    *   isOrdinal indicates whether this data is Ordinal (true) or Nominal (false)
    *   value is the data value of this data point
    *   depend is the Y (dependent) value associated with this data point
    * 2) It represents the skeleton of the tree as the tree is built from the root down
    *   and the data points are subsumed (summarized) by the evolving tree structure.
    *   These cases can be identified by id = 0.
    *   2a) It represents branch (split) nodes:
    *       id = 0 -- All data was subsumed
    *       number > 0 -- The original field number of the X variable on which to split
    *       value -- the value on which to split
    *       parentId -- The nodeId of the branch at the previous level that leads to this
    *                   node.  Zero only for root.
    *       level -- The distance from the root (root = 1)
    *       support -- The number of data points that reach this node
    *       ir -- The impurity reduction for this split
    *   2b) It represents leaf nodes:
    *       id = 0 -- All data was subsumed
    *       number = 0 -- This discriminates a leaf from a branch node
    *       depend has the Y value for that leaf
    *       parentId has the nodeId of the branch node at the previous level
    *       support has the count of samples that reached this leaf
    *       level -- The depth of the node in the tree (root = 1)
    * Each tree starts with all sampled data points assigned to the root node (i.e. level = 1, nodeId = 1)
    * As the trees grow, data points are assigned to deeper branches, and eventually to leaf nodes, where
    * they are ultimately subsumed (summarized) and removed from the dataset.
    * At the end of the forest growing process only the tree skeleton remains -- all the datapoints having
    * been summarized by the resulting branch and leaf nodes.
