/**
  * Regression Forest
  *
  * Regression using Random Forest.
  * This module implements Random Forest regression as described by
  * Breiman, 2001 with extensions.
  * (see https://www.stat.berkeley.edu/~breiman/randomforest2001.pdf)
  *
  * Random Forests provide an effective method for regression
  * with few assumptions about the nature of the data.  They are known
  * to be one of the best out-of-the-box methods as there are few assumptions
  * made regarding the nature of the data or its relationships.
  * Random Forests can effectively manage large numbers
  * of features, and will automatically choose the most relevant features.
  *
  * Regression Forests can handle non-linear and discontinuous relationships
  * among features.
  *
  * One limitation of Regression Forests is that they provide no extrapolation
  * beyond the bounds of the training data.  The training set should extend to the
  * limits of expected feature values.
  *
  * This implementation allows both Ordinal (discrete or continuous) and
  * Nominal (unordered categorical values) for the independent (X) features.
  * There is therefore, no need to one-hot encode categorical features.
  * Nominal features should be identified by including their feature 'number'
  * in the set of 'nominalFields' in GetModel.
  *
  * Notes on use of NumericField layouts:
  * - Work-item ids ('wi' field) are not required to be sequential, though they must be positive
  *   numbers
  * - Record Ids ('id' field) are not required to be sequential, though slightly faster performance
  *   will result if they are sequential (i.e. 1 .. numRecords) for each work-item
  * - Feature numbers ('number' field) are not required to be sequential, though slightly faster
  *   performance will result if they are (i.e. 1 .. numFeatures) for each work-item

  * @param numTrees The number of trees to create as the forest for each work-item.
  *                 This defaults to 100, which is adequate for most cases.
  * @param featuresPerNode The number of features to choose among at each split in
  *                 each tree.  This number of features will be chosen at random
  *                 from the full set of features.  The default is the square
  *                 root of the number of features provided, which works well
  *                 for most cases.
  * @param maxDepth The deepest to grow any tree in the forest.  The default is
  *                 64, which is adequate for most purposes.  Increasing this value
  *                 for very large and complex problems my provide slightly greater
  *                 accuracy at the expense of much greater runtime.
  * @param nominalFields An optional set of field 'numbers' that represent Nominal (i.e. unordered,
  *                      categorical) values.  Specifying the nominal fields improves run-time
  *                      performance on these fields and may improve accuracy as well.  Binary fields
  *                      (fields with only two values) need not be included here as they can be
  *                      considered either ordinal or nominal.  The default is to treat all fields as
  *                      ordered.  Note that this feature should only be used if all of the independent
  *                      data for all work-items use the same record format, and therefore have the same
  *                      set of nominal fields.
